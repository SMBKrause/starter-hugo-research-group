Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, are produced during decomposition of plant matter in the sediments of lakes and wetlands. Certain bacteria consume much of this methane, reducing the net amount released into the atmosphere. In this study, Dr. Krause examined community interactions between methane-consuming bacteria such as methanotrophs and other associated microbes. It appears that the methanotrophs receive signals from other bacteria in the community to convert some of the methane to methanol. The methanol serves as food for those non-consumers of methane. These results suggest certain microbial community partners can alter gene expression in other community members. This alteration has important implications for microbial interactions in the environment.
